# N-Queens And Knights Optimization
A project by Sapir Deutscher and Almog Lev in optimization course.
We extended the N-Queens NP-Complete problem with new constraints of the Knight's possible moves and called it "N-Queens And Knights".
This new NP-Complete problem we defined is optimzed by the Hill Climbing Artifical Intelligence algorithm, implemented in 2 versiosn:
1. First Choice Hill Climbing
2. Stochastic Hill Climbing

For further details check the Project.pdf file and the Presentation.pdf file.
